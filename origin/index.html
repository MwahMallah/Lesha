                        <p>As a child, Abbar was placed in foster care after his father, in a quest for survival, traded him for an ancient table lamp. This betrayal left an irreparable void in Abbar's soul, and art became his only way to express his emotions.</p>
                        <p>Years later, Abbar becomes a recognized artist, but the shadow of the past continues to cast a dark shadow over his work. He withdraws into himself, stops taking care of his own health, forgetting about food and drink. His works are filled with painful beauty and deep emotional undertones.</p>
                        <p>One day, Abbar receives an order to create a masterpiece, which should express his inner cry after his father's betrayal. This becomes his most ambitious and difficult project.</p>
